The article I picked is ["Adobeâ€™s Figma acquisition is a $20 billion bet to control the entire creative market"](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/17/23357404/adobe-figma-acquisition-20-billion-bet-control-creative-market-antitrust) written by Jay Petters for The Verge. The article briefly talks about the recent aqcuirement of Figma by Adobe and the changes that are expected to happen in the design platform. Figma was sold for $20 billion, and is now part of the Adobe Creative Cloud. THe community is not very pleased with this because Figma was known for being affordable, which is the complete opposite of the Adobe products. Designers are now concerned that Figma will be a new version of Adobe XD, the UI/UX design platform from Adobe and not very loved by the designing community.
I believe that Figma being part of Adobe is a step back for Figma. MAking designing affordable and easy for everyone is a great mission for today's reality, and selling the software to Adobe can completely change that. In addition, Adobe now owns every single big designing software in the market, and I believe that when that's the case, the platforms are going to stop improving in the same rate that they were before.

My sister is a creative type, and she shares your disdain for Adobe. However, I am optimistic that Figma can remain mostly independent, as the article suggests.

I think something that is overlooked in the wake of all these technological advancements and achievements in certain fields, is where the market for things like this need to be controlled and regulated. I completely agree that Adobe's grasp over design-related software is an issue. In many artist circles, for example, I know that there is an ever-present struggle to find software that does what Photoshop does, without the hefty price tag. Amazon is a fantastic example of one company that everyone relies upon completely dominating a particular industry, and using its wealth and influences to push out smaller competitors.
